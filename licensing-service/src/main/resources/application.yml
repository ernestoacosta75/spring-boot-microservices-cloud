# After set up the pom.xml file, we need to tell Spring Boot to register
# the organization service with Eureka. This registration is done via
# additional configuration in this application file.
#
# Every service registered with Eureka will have two components associated
# with it: the application ID and the instance ID. The application ID is
# used to represent a group service instance. In a Spring-Boot-based microservice
# the application ID will always be the value set by the "spring.application.name"
# property that is defined in the bootstrap.yml file. For the organization service,
# this property is creatively named "organizationservice". The instance ID will be
# a random number meant to represent a single service instance.
#
# The second part of the configuration provides how and where the service should be
# register with the Eureka service. The "eureka.instance.preferIpAddress" property
# tells Eureka that you want to register the service's IP address to Eureka rather
# than its hostname.
#
# The "eureka.client.registerWithEureka" attribute is the trigger to tell the orga-
# nization service to register itself with Eureka. The "eureka.client.fetchRegistry"
# attribute is used to tell the Spring Eureka Client to fetch a local copy of the registry.
# Setting this attribute to true will cache the registry locally instead of calling the Eureka
# service with every lookup. Every 30 seconds, the client software will re-contact the
# Eureka service for any changes to the registry.
#
# The last attribute, the eureka.serviceUrl.defaultZone attribute, holds a comma-separated list
# of Eureka services the client will use to resolve to service locations. For our purposes,
# youâ€™re only going to have one Eureka service.
